## A Bit About Me

As a dedicated member of MoonDAO, I'm actively involved in pushing the boundaries of space technology and advocating for the acceleration of our journey towards becoming a multiplanetary species. From fostering discussions on the latest advancements to engaging with the community of space enthusiasts and crypto aficionados, I strive to play my part in shaping the future of space exploration.

## Wanderlust and Wonder

As a long time nomad, you'll often find me indulging my wanderlust. Traveling allows me to gain new perspectives, immerse myself in diverse cultures, and marvel at the wonders of our world. Whether it's traversing bustling city streets or scaling to the top of a remote mountain peak, each journey fuels my curiosity and expands my horizons.

My space-related travels have taken me to Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center with a unique behind the scenes tour including to the floor of Mission Control, SpaceX's Starbase in Brownsville, Texas, and even aboard a zero gravity flight alongside three NASA astronauts.

I've been to a number of space museums, including: 
- Cape Canaveral Space Force Museum 
- Sands Space History Center
- The INFINITY Science Center
- New Mexico Museum of Space History
